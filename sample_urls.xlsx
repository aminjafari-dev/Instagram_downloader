This file should be created manually by the user or using pandas.

To create a sample Excel file with Instagram URLs, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame with Instagram URLs
data = {
    'url': [
        'https://www.instagram.com/p/ABC123/',
        'https://www.instagram.com/p/DEF456/',
        'https://www.instagram.com/p/GHI789/',
    ]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_excel('sample_urls.xlsx', index=False)
```

The Excel file must have a column containing Instagram video URLs. By default, the column should be named 'url', but you can specify a different column name in the GUI.
